## Installation

You need to install RISE following the instructions here: https://github.com/damianavila/RISE

We assume python3, jupyter, svgwrite and the Chrome browser

To run execute `jupyter notebook` and pick the appropriate notebeook. I suggest the creation of a notebook per tutorial section in order to avoid having very large notebooks that would be difficult to edit collaboratively.
