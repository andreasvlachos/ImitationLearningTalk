# ImitationLearningTutorialEACL2017

Structure:

Part 1

Section 1.1
- introduction/motivation: where have they seen this before, recent paper, e.g. dynamic oracles, reinforcement learning for anaphora?
- structure prediiction basics->transition-based
- kinds of supervision: per-action, end reward
- decomposability

Section 1.2
Pos tagging example interleaved with the algorithm
- exact imitation
- DAgger
- with roll outs and non-decomposable loss
- latent variables
- Cost-sensitive classification

Section 1.3
Connections with RNNs
Bandit learning
Adversarial training

Part 2

- Dependency parsing: heuristic expert definition
- NLG
- Semantic parsing
- focused costing, sequence correction, targeted exploration, changeprop, asymmetric losses for trade off accuracy runtim, precision recall
